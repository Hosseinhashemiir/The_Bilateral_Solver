#The Fast Bilateral Solver

**The Bilater Solver** is a novel algorithm for edge-aware smoothing that combines the flexibility and speed of simple filtering approaches with the accuracy of domain-specific optimization algorithms. This algorithm was presented by Jonathan T. Barron and Ben Poole as an ECCV2016 oral and best paper nominee. Algorithm details and applications can be found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03296.pdf .
